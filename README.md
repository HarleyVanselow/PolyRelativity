PolyRelativity
Harley Vanselow

PolyRelativity features an exercise in inheritance and polymorphism. From the PolyRelativity/Shapes.cs file,
several classes of object are defined that interact with each other in different ways. All of these interactions are 
showcased in PolyRelativity/Form1.cs, which draws examples of the possible classes of shape, as well as the
cross class interactions between them.
